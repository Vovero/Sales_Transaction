This dataset represents one year of sales transactions for a UK-based e-commerce retailer specializing in gifts and homewares for adults and children. Operating since 2007, this London-based business sells products through its website to customers worldwide. While most purchases are direct, some small businesses buy in bulk for resale through retail outlets. 

The dataset includes 500,000 rows and 8 columns, with the following details: 

TransactionNo (categorical): A unique six-digit identifier for each transaction. A "C" in the code denotes a cancellation. 

Date (numeric): The date the transaction occurred. 

ProductNo (categorical): A unique five or six-digit code for each product. 

Product (categorical): The name of the product or item. 

Price (numeric): The unit price of the product in pound sterling (£). 

Quantity (numeric): The number of units purchased in a transaction. Negative values indicate canceled transactions. 

CustomerNo (categorical): A unique five-digit identifier for each customer. 

Country (categorical): The name of the country where the customer resides. 

A small percentage of orders in the dataset were canceled, primarily due to out-of-stock items. Customers often cancel orders when they cannot receive all products together in a single delivery.
